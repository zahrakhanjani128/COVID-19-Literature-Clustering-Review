Hi everyone, My name is Zahra, and I am an enthusiastic data scientist eager to contribute to team success through hard work, attention to detail and excellent organizational skills. My favorite topic in Data Science is Natural Language Processing (NLP).
# COVID-19-Literature-Clustering-Review
 Clustering methods are used to keep similar research articles together which may simplify researching on COVID-19 (Eren et al, 2020). 
 This project is a brief review about how we can cluster COVID-19 literature. The primary reference is:
@inproceedings{COVID-19 Literature Clustering,

# NLP_for_DisasterTweets
This file contains what I did regarding a Kaggle project with the name of: (Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets). This is a binary text classification. You need to predict which tweet talks about a real disaster and which one is about a fake disaster or other things (except a real disaster). I used different preprocessing methods as well as modellings for the text data. Hope to enjoy this file.
